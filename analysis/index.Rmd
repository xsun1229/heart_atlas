We are trying to To address the reviewers comments for 'Heart-atlas' project here. 

# Comments

1a. Compare cell type clusters with two other single-cell chromatin studies in heart tissue ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33990324/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34774128/ ). The first paper specifically focused on the heart, the second one mapped accessibility across many human tissues.

1b. Compare OCRs with existing single-cell studies

2. Explain why most open chromatin regions (OCRs) with cell-type-specific accessibility are enriched in intronic regions

# Approaches

Compare our data with published snATAC-seq data from the Ren lab (2 different papers).
 
a. Compare OCRs with existing single-cell studies

b. Obtain the genomic distribution of the cell-type-specific peaks .

# Results 

## Comparison with the first dataset
